/**
 * 5. Write a program that takes the base and height of a triangle and return its area.
 * Formula --> A=(height*base)/2
 * Example:
 * input => base = 3, height = 2
 *      => (2 * 3)/2
 *      => 6/2
 *      => 3
 * output => Triangle's area is 3

/**
 * 6. In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals.
 * The farmer breeds three species:
 * chickens = 2 legs
 * cows = 4 legs
 * pigs = 4 legs
 * The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species.
 * You have to implement a program that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.
 * Example:
 * input => chickens = 2, cows = 3, pigs = 5
 *      => (2 * 2) + (3 * 4) + (5 * 4)
 * output => 36 legs
 * PD: Use an Enum.
